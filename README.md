Such that HMM3 gamers can focus on gaming instead of spending time scrolling through 150 pages of maps to find a map that he/she wants to play. By initialising the downloader with specific conditions such as minimum number of teams, Can be Human and map size. 

Motivated from own experience, where I wanted to play maps with a buddy of mine and we should be allied, i.e. we only wanted to play maps with at leat 2 teams and 2 Can be Human.
